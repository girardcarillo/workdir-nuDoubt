The main change for these data sets is the diameter (3mm) and spacing (1cm) of the fibres.

Detector material: 98% LAB, 2% paraffin wax detector.
Detector: 4m long and 4m in diameter.
Fibre array: hex z-parallel, 1cm fibre pitch. Fibre diameter = 3mm.
Fibre numbering: aaabbb where aaa is the row number and bbb is the column number.

Scattering Length = 2mm
Absorption Length = 2m
Scintillation Yield = 9000 photons/MeV

particle gun: (75mm, 75mm, 0mm) random direction

The final number in the file name is the number of events in the file.
