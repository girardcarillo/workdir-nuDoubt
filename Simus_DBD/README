Fibre diameter (3mm)
Fibre spacing (1cm)

Detector material: 98% LAB, 2% paraffin wax detector.
Detector: 3m long and 3m in diameter.
Fibre array: hex z-parallel, 1cm fibre pitch. Fibre diameter = 3mm.
Fibre numbering: aaabbb where aaa is the row number and bbb is the column number.

Scattering Length = 2mm
Absorption Length = 2m
Scintillation Yield = 9000 photons/MeV

particle gun: (6.2 mm, 4.2 mm, 0mm) random direction

The final number in the file name is the number of events in the file.

Structure of the Root file:
fEvent: unique identifier for an event
fX, fY, fZ: position of the optical hit on the fiber
No: fiber number of the optical hit
vX, vY: production point of (scintillation or Cherenkov) light
