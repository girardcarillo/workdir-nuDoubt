Fibre diameter (1mm)
Fibre spacing (2cm)

Detector material: 98% LAB, 2% paraffin wax detector.
Detector: 4000mm long and 1600mm in diameter.
Fibre array: hex z-parallel

Scattering Length = 2mm
Absorption Length = 2m
Scintillation Yield = 9000 photons/MeV

particle gun: position in inner detector, random direction, energy between 0 and 5 MeV

The final number in the file name is the number of events in the file.

Structure of the Root file:
fEvent: unique identifier for an event
fX, fY, fZ: position of the optical hit on the fiber
No: fiber number of the optical hit
vX, vY: production point of (scintillation or Cherenkov) light
